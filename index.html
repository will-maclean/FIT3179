            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The Australian busfires of 2019/20, commonly known as the Black Summer, were some of the most devestating on record. More
                than 18 million hectares of land were burnt, along with 2500+ homes. Tragically, more than 30 people also lost their 
                lives in various blazes over the summer.

                Here, we attempt to reveal the intensity and longevity of the fires over that summer. We'll show some snapshots of fire
                intensity at various places and times across the country. We'll then investigate the nation's response - economic and
                otherwise.

            <h3>New Years Eve</h3>
            The 2019/20 bushfire season started earlier than usual in August, due to a dry winter. The fires then peaked during December
            and January. A common misconception is that there was one, single, fire - rather, there were hundreds of individual fires
            across the summer and across the country.

            </br>
            Figure 2 shows a snapshot of the whole country, at the peak of the fires. The heatmap shows the intensity of the fire as
            measured by satellite. Note again the number of different fires. The fires were most commonly spread through Victoria and 
            NSW, however they were also abundant on the Eastern coast of Queensland, through South Australia and up into Western Australia.
            </br>
            This snapshot is from December 30 2019. On New Year's day,
            New Zealanders living on the South Island woke up to large parts of their island being covered in smoke from the 
            Australian fires.

                    Kangaroo Island, just off the coast of South Australia, was severly affected by the fires. By early 2020,
                    around 170,000 hectares of land had been burnt. This corresponds to around a third of the entire island. This
                    had huge environmental impact, as Kangaroo Island is home to endangered wildlife such as the critically endangered
                    Kangaroo Island Dunnart, and an endangered subspecies of Glossy Black Cockatoo.

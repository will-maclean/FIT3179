            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The Australian busfires of 2019/20, commonly known as the Black Summer, were some of the most devestating on record. More
                than 18 million hectares of land were burnt, along with 2500+ homes. Tragically, more than 30 people also lost their 
                lives in various blazes over the summer.
            </br>
                Here, we attend to reveal the intensity and longevity of the fires over that summer. We'll show some snapshots of fire
                intensity at various places and times across the country. We'll then investigate the nation's response - eceonomic and
                otherwise.

            <h2>Maps of fires</h2>
            The 2019/20 bushfire season started earlier than usual in August, due to a dry winter. The fires then peaked during December
            and January. A common misconception is that there was one, single, fire - rather, there were hundreds of individual fires
            across the summer and across the country.

            Figure 1 shows a snapshot of the whole country, at the peak of the fires. The heatmap shows the intensity of the fire as
            measured by satellite. Note again the number of different fires.
